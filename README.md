# PHP-Calculator
Basic calculator interface created in PHP to showcase knowledge in Unit Testing/Functional Testing

• To access the calculator itself:
Clone the project to your local machine, open XAMPP, then paste the project files into your htdocs folder. 
From there, after ensuring your port connection is OK, connect via localhost. 
For example, my directory would be: "http://localhost:8095/PHP-Calculator/app/". You have now accessed the calculator.

• To perform unit testing:
First, access the testing branch of this project. Open a Bash terminal and make sure all your dependencies are present and up to date.
It should look something like this:

Then, to confirm PHPUnit is correctly installed, execute this command from the same Bash terminal:

And finally, to perform the unit testing on user values for the calculator, you can input this command:

If you get any errors, make sure your PHP configuration, PHPUnit installation, and XAMPP/Port configurations are all correctly set up.

Thanks!
